## Election-Audit Summary 
The election commission can use the script for future elections with respective modifications. First, if the results file doesnâ€™t have header, header = next(reader) is not required. Second, the user should make sure which column candidate names are recorded. For example, row [2] means candidate names are in the third column. Similarly, the user will need to modify the row number for county name.
